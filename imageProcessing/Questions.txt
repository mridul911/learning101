Q1-What is image?
------->An image is nothing but a binary representation of some visual information.In other words,an image is a two dimentional array of square pixels arranged in rows and coloumns.
Q2----->brightness-overall lightness or darkness of image.Decreasing the brightness make every pixel in frame darker.
------->Contrast-difference in brightness between objects in the image.Increasing the contrast makes light areas lighter and dark area in the frame becomes much darker.
-------->Hue-represents color of something,main indication of color.Value actually telling about color.
------->Saturation-Value of how dominant the color is.
Q3--->image processing and computer vision-> THEY both involve doing some computation on images.
Image processing focus on well processing images.it means that input and output are both images which undergo image processing algorithm.
Computer vision on other hand focuses on making sense of what a machine sees.it input an image and outputs task specific knowledge such as labels and many information attach to it.
we can say computer vision is superset of image processing.
